            <li>この言葉には深ーい意味がある。</li>

            <li>全部神様の力や。わしらの作る組紐も神様の技、時間の流れそのものをあらわしとる</li>
            <li>よりあつまって形を作り捻じれて絡まって時には戻って途切れてまたつながって」</li>

            Musubi is the old way of calling the local guardian god. This word has profound meaning. Tying thread is Musubi. Connecting people is Musubi. The flow of time is Musubi. These are all the god's power. So the braided cords that we make are the god's art
            and represent the flow of time itself. They converge and take shape. They twist, tangle sometimes unravel, break, then connect again. </p>
        <p> Musubi to me is when the weave bends, twists, straightens, loops, when your heart skips a beat, that split second when everything goes horribly wrong, the surge of energy when you're around a certain group of people. Musubi is the evening after
            school when you stare out the window into the sky for hours. Musubi is eagerly waiting for the guests to arrive. Musubi is the sound of the gong in your head when you come back to your senses and realise you've caused hurt. It is sitting in
            a dark room and writing at 4 in the morning and it is the sound of a mobile notification in a crowded train. It is reading a book with someone you love and it is running your friend to the hospital at midnight. It is sunlight flowing through
            the leaves and it is a dead bird on the ground. It is a colorful 100-yen store and it is a dark highway. It is stretching out your legs. It is an old tailor. It is a monolith. It is what it is.
